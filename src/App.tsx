                Waterloo with a minor in astrophysics and a minor in German.
                <br />
                <br />I am currently working as a programmer-analyst for Shared
                Services Canada, where I use Blazor, C# and Azure to develop a
                cloud-based analytics platform for Canadian scientists.
