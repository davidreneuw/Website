# Personal website

This is the source code for my personal website. It uses React and Typescript with ES6.

When making this website, I always made sure to make it easily customizable, and so I opted for a JSON file to store all the data. This way, you can easily change the data without having to touch the code.

This inspired me to make a small project in the future that would allow to create a resume using the information present in the JSON file, with several toggles and options allowing you to easily customize the resume.
